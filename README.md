# Kalman_Filter_Mass_Spring_Control
Using MATLAB and SIMULINK, this benchmark problem is to model and control an under-observed mass-spring system. I choose to utilize a Kalman Filter in order to: 1. Estimate unobserved states, 2. Maintain robustness under plant uncertainty, 3. Maintain reference tracking despite sensor and plant noise, 4. Re-stabilize after impulse disturbances.
